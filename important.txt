If you see any randome image,

1) Add your image to IPFS
2) Add a metadata file pointing to that image file present in IPFS
3) Then grab that token uri of metadata and set is as your NFT.

In order to see your files on IPFs, open IPFS desktop, copy the CID link, and then paste it like: 
a) 'ipfs://link' -> ipfs://QmchKkxGb2MZ7s1h8CAaiatrvdW8UjraSkvHjQxDorAbta -> This direclty link to ipfs network which is distributed
OR
b) 'ipfs.io/ipfs/link' -> https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmchKkxGb2MZ7s1h8CAaiatrvdW8UjraSkvHjQxDorAbta -> This links to ipfs centralised website

- Type 'chisel' in terminal to enter an arena, where you can try randome codes and etc.

1) forge install ChainAccelOrg/foundry-devops -> to install all necessary contracts

2) make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia" -> To deploy the project on Sepolia testnet
- Dont forget ETHERSCAN api key from etherscal
- Dont forget RPC_URL from alchemy
- Dont forget PRIVATE_KEY from metamask (account having sepolia testnet)

3) make mint ARGS="--network sepolia" -> Run this command also to mint the NFT

4) In order to see your NFT on metamask, do the following process: 
    a) Copy the address of contract (When you run command 2), you get link of etherscan -> Go to that link -> Go to contract section -> Copy the contract address )
    b) Now Go to metamask and import NFT
    c) Enter the address and enter Id (starts with 0 , u enter 0 at start ).
